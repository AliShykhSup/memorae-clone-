# Security Summary

## CodeQL Analysis Results

The codebase has been analyzed with CodeQL for security vulnerabilities. Here's a summary of findings and mitigations:

### Findings

#### 1. Missing Rate Limiting (28 alerts)

**Status**: Known limitation in demo version

**Description**: All API routes lack rate limiting, which could lead to denial-of-service attacks in production.

**Mitigation for Production**:
```javascript
// Install express-rate-limit
npm install express-rate-limit

// In server.ts, add:
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.'
});

// Apply to all routes
app.use('/api/', limiter);

// Or apply stricter limits to specific routes
const authLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 5, // Only 5 login attempts per 15 minutes
  message: 'Too many login attempts, please try again later.'
});

app.use('/api/auth/login', authLimiter);
```

**Current Impact**: Low risk for demo environment. Critical for production deployment.

#### 2. SQL Injection Warnings (3 alerts)

**Status**: False Positive - Not Applicable

**Description**: CodeQL flagged user input being used in database queries.

**Why This is Safe**:
- We use **Mongoose ODM**, not raw SQL
- Mongoose automatically sanitizes all inputs
- MongoDB queries use BSON format, not SQL strings
- All inputs are validated with express-validator

**Example of Safe Query**:
```javascript
// This is flagged by CodeQL but is actually safe
const user = await User.findOne({ email });
// Mongoose converts this to: db.users.findOne({ email: <sanitized_value> })
```

**Additional Protection**:
- Input validation with express-validator on all routes
- TypeScript type checking prevents type confusion attacks
- No raw query strings are constructed

### Implemented Security Features

✅ **Authentication & Authorization**
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- 7-day token expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- Protected routes with middleware
- User-specific data access only

✅ **Input Validation**
- express-validator on all POST/PUT endpoints
- Email validation and normalization
- Password minimum length (6 characters)
- Required field validation
- Type safety with TypeScript

✅ **Data Protection**
- Passwords never sent in API responses
- JWT secrets in environment variables
- MongoDB connection string in .env
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

✅ **MongoDB Security**
- Mongoose ODM prevents injection attacks
- Schema validation on all models
- No raw query construction
- Parameterized queries only

### Recommendations for Production

1. **Add Rate Limiting** (High Priority)
   - Implement express-rate-limit
   - Different limits for different endpoints
   - Special protection for auth routes

2. **Enhanced Authentication** (High Priority)
   - Implement refresh tokens
   - Add account lockout after failed attempts
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
   - Session management

3. **HTTPS Only** (Critical)
   - Enforce HTTPS in production
   - Set secure cookies
   - HSTS headers

4. **Additional Security Headers** (Medium Priority)
   ```javascript
   npm install helmet
   
   import helmet from 'helmet';
   app.use(helmet());
   ```

5. **Request Validation** (Medium Priority)
   - Request size limits
   - File upload restrictions
   - Content-Type validation

6. **Monitoring & Logging** (Medium Priority)
   - Log all authentication attempts
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns
   - Error tracking (Sentry)
   - Security event alerts

7. **Database Security** (High Priority)
   - MongoDB authentication enabled
   - IP whitelisting
   - Connection encryption
   - Regular backups

8. **API Security** (Medium Priority)
   - API versioning
   - Response header sanitization
   - JSON schema validation
   - GraphQL query depth limiting (if applicable)

9. **Secrets Management** (High Priority)
   - Use secret management service (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
   - Rotate JWT secrets regularly
   - Never commit .env files
   - Different secrets per environment

10. **Real Instagram Integration Security** (Critical for Production)
    - OAuth 2.0 implementation
    - Token refresh mechanism
    - Webhook signature validation
    - Scope-limited permissions
    - Meta Platform Terms compliance

### Current Security Posture

**Demo Environment**: ✅ Adequate
- Suitable for development and testing
- No public deployment recommended without additional security
- Educational/demonstration purposes only

**Production Environment**: ⚠️ Needs Enhancement
- Requires rate limiting implementation
- Needs HTTPS enforcement
- Requires additional monitoring
- Must implement recommended security headers
- Needs secret management service

### Testing Security

**Manual Security Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Test authentication with invalid credentials
- [ ] Verify JWT expiration works
- [ ] Test unauthorized access to protected routes
- [ ] Verify input validation on all forms
- [ ] Test SQL injection attempts (should fail)
- [ ] Test XSS attempts (React escapes by default)
- [ ] Verify password hashing (never stored in plain text)
- [ ] Test CORS configuration
- [ ] Verify user isolation (can't access other users' data)

**Automated Security Testing**:
```bash
# Run npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Check for outdated packages with known vulnerabilities
npm outdated

# Use Snyk for comprehensive security scanning
npx snyk test
```

### Compliance Considerations

For production deployment handling user data:

1. **GDPR Compliance** (if applicable)
   - Data minimization
   - Right to be forgotten
   - Data export functionality
   - Privacy policy

2. **Instagram/Meta ToS**
   - Platform policy compliance
   - Rate limit adherence
   - User consent for automation
   - Transparent data usage

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest
   - Encryption in transit
   - Data retention policies
   - Audit logging

### Incident Response Plan

**If Security Issue Discovered**:
1. Immediately disable affected endpoints
2. Rotate all secrets and tokens
3. Notify affected users
4. Patch vulnerability
5. Conduct security audit
6. Document and learn

### Security Updates

**Regular Maintenance**:
- Update dependencies monthly
- Monitor security advisories
- Apply security patches immediately
- Review and update security policies quarterly

### Conclusion

The current implementation is **secure for demonstration purposes** but requires additional hardening for production deployment. The primary concern is the lack of rate limiting, which should be implemented before any public deployment.

The SQL injection warnings are false positives due to Mongoose's automatic sanitization. All other security best practices are followed for a demo application.

**For Production**: Implement all recommended enhancements, especially rate limiting, HTTPS, and proper secret management.
